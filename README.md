* 👋 Hi, I'm @borismwanga! I'm a web development enthusiast and recent bootcamp grad from Belgium, and I'm passionate about building beautiful, functional websites and web applications. In my free time, I enjoy playing football, watching movies, and exploring new technologies.

* 👀 I'm interested in a wide range of topics, including front-end and back-end development, user experience design, and project management. I'm also interested in     exploring new frameworks, libraries, and tools that can help me build better, more efficient websites and applications.

* 🌱 I'm currently learning more about modern web development practices, including responsive design, progressive web apps, and serverless architecture. I'm also working on improving my skills with popular frameworks like React and Vue.js, and I'm eager to learn more about emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning.

* 💬 I'm a native French speaker, and I'm also proficient in English and Dutch (B1 level). I'm excited to collaborate with people from a variety of backgrounds and language skills, and I'm always looking to improve my language abilities.

* 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on projects that are interesting, challenging, and fun. I'm open to working on a wide range of projects, from small, experimental ideas to larger, more complex projects.
